## Description
This is the second challenge for the UTA bootcamp. This challenge was created to apply CSS flexbox, media queries, and pseduo classes. The purpose of this project is to build our own professional portfolio that we can add and improve on as we progress throughout the course. 

## Usage 
On the portfolio website, you can see what topics are avaialble on the navbar. You can click on each of the topic and it will scroll the page down to that section where you can view that information. If you are in the work section you will be able to see images you can click that will navigate you to information about my work. The contact section will also allow you to click on each type of contact that will navigate you to that information.
